# ComputerScienceProjects2021
These are some of my projects ive developed during my 2021 year at SFSU. They include a photo web appication that allows you to make accounts, photo posts and comments using mysql, a virtual file system coded in c for linux, and a full stack react app with a java backend and mongodb that acts as a listing app. 

Web Photo App
 - uses javascript and mysql that acts as an instagram clone
 - users can create accounts, photo posts, and comment on other posts
 
Run Instructions:
in the root of the folder cd into the application folder
run npm i then npm start



File System Project
- uses c to emulate a virtual file system 
- users can create directories, delete directories, move directories, cd to another location in the file system, move files to other directories, see how big files and directories are, and has changes saved to the virtual hard drive
